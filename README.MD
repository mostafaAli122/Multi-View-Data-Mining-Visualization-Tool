#Multi view data minig visualization tool
Since the amount of data for each organization is very large , the organizations are looking for ways to make use of that large amounts of data. This data is needed to generate or extract useful information as much as possible to help the organizations’ managers to do some actions or take decisions to grow up without having to discover these large amounts of data on their own .
In our project we develop a desktop based software application that not only applies some processing techniques on that data to extract the useful information but also visualizes the results that come out from the processing phase. The visualization techniques are dependent on the problem that need to be solved and also the software can help the user to manipulate data on graphs.
